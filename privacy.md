# BeeBot Privacy Policy

Effective Date: September 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains what information BeeBot (“the Bot”) collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information. By using BeeBot, you agree to the practices described below.

Privacy Summary
BeeBot only records the minimum information needed for its features to work (like Discord IDs for users, guilds, channels, and messages). No personal data is collected, stored, or shared. Data is never sold or given to third parties, except if required by law.
________________________________________
1. Information We Collect
   
To provide BeeBot’s core functionality, the following information may be recorded:
•	User IDs – Collected for requestors of artisan requests and users who commit to or contribute to those requests.
•	Guild IDs, Channel IDs, and Message IDs – Collected to track requests, guild bank transactions, and event timers.
________________________________________
2. How We Use This Information
   
This information is used only for BeeBot’s core features, such as:
•	Logging and tracking artisan requests.
•	Maintaining guild bank functionality.
•	Managing event timers.
________________________________________
3. Data Retention

•	Information is stored only as long as necessary for BeeBot’s features to function.
•	If data is no longer needed (e.g., a request is completed, or a timer is cleared), it may be deleted or overwritten.
________________________________________
4. No Third-Party Sharing
   
•	BeeBot does not sell, share, or distribute any information to third parties.
•	Information will only be disclosed if required by law.
________________________________________
5. Security
   
Reasonable measures are taken to protect any data stored by BeeBot. However, no system is completely secure, and use of BeeBot is at your own risk.
________________________________________
6. Your Rights
   
Since BeeBot only stores limited Discord-related IDs and no personal information, your rights are simple:
•	You may stop using BeeBot at any time.
•	If you are a server administrator, you may remove BeeBot from your server, which will prevent future data collection.
________________________________________
7. Changes to This Policy
   
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of BeeBot after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
